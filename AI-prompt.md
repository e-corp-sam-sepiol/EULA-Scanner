# EULA Scanner / AI Prompt

This is an English prompt to provide AI when providing the dumped EULA information for manual analysis, to ensure consistent and useful response. 

```
Analyze the attached EULA dump for games, focusing on kernel level access, data collection and potential access to unrelated files, web browsers, or keystrokes. From a technical and legal perspective, assess the extent to which these games could access such data. Categorize each game for installation on either a DRM/privacy-invasive OS or a DRM-free/privacy-respecting OS, prioritizing minimal system intrusion. Keep the response brief, structured, and simple, using minimal words while addressing technical capabilities and legal constraints. Recommend precautions for the DRM OS. Prioritize the legal language found in the EULA dump over the provided recommendation(s) made in the EULA dump when considering what OS you'd recommend installing a game to. Please provide only a table as a response, with your recommendation of what OS you'd install the game(s) to, and for what reason, and can you group them so that the games recommended for the DRM OS are at the top of the table.
